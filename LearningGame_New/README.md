Math Game v.2
========================

## Math Game with new UI. 

### Game modes include

    addition -user sets upper and lower bounds on addends.
    
    subtraction -user sets upper and lower bounds on minuend and subtrahend. no negative answers at this time.
    
	addition & subtraction -a blend of the two. user sets upper and lower bounds.
	
    multiplication -user sets upper and lower bounds on multiplicand and multiplier.
    
    division -user sets upper and lower bounds on dividend and divisor. All answers are whole numbers at this time.
    
	multiplication & division -a blend of the two. user sets upper and lower bounds.
	
    times tables -user sets the multiplicand and multiplier upper bound. Problems will range from multiplicand * (0-multiplier selected).
    
    equations -simple equations for beginning practice determining value of variable.
    
	word problems -simple word problems for practicing reading math problems and determining answer.
	
### Recently added

	background rain changes to green when correct answer provided and red when incorrect.
	slowed the fall of background rain animation
	

### Recently removed

	removed bonus questions: user feedback determined this feature as undesirable.

### Coming Soon

	percent problems
	money math problems
    
### Feature road map

	remove transition delay
	when beginning practice mode it will ask how many problems to complete rather than how many the user will get correct before quitting
	implement a completed / results pop up like v1 had
	by default the ongoing stats / progress display will be hidden. this menu will be expandable
	add timer to the results / ongoing progress display (for practice mode)
	backed by database
	leader boards
	include negative addition and subtraction
	include negative multiplication and division
	
### There are some known bugs. 

These will be corrected as capacity allows.
